                                           LPG GAS LEAKAGE DETECTION AND SMS ALERT SYSTEM
                                           
                                           
Objective :

The gas leakage detector detects inflammable gases like Carbon dioxide,Butane and LPG and immediately send an alerting message to a selected mobile number and display the status of the gas leak in an LCD screen.

Abstract :

The gas leakage detector is a domestic device which helps detect inflammable gas leakage in a common household.Detecting the gas leakage by the naked nose is difficult and inaccurate.So,the gas leakage detector helps in this way that,it provides an automated solution for gas detection with utmost accuracy and precision.

The device performs the following:

(i) Detects Gas Leakage (like LPG leak, Butane leak, Methane leak) or any such petroleum based gaseous substance that can be detected using MQ9 Sensor.

(ii) Sets up an SMS based Alert Mechanism and sends an alert messages to the specified mobile number(input inside the arduino program).

Components Required :

-> Arduino Uno

-> GSM sim 900A Module

-> MQ-9 Sensor

-> Connecting Wires

-> 12V power supply adapter
